/*ATM Withdrawal Simulation. (Follow Below Steps to Write Program)

Steps to Write the Program

1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the account balance with a fixed amount (e.g., ‚Çπ10,000).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Take user input for the amount they want to withdraw.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Check withdrawal conditions:
The amount should be greater than zero.
The amount should be a multiple of 100 (common ATM rule).
The amount should not exceed the account balance.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Deduct the amount from the balance if conditions are met.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Display the updated balance or an error message if the withdrawal fails.
