9. Interface Polymorphism
ðŸ”¶ Objective:
Learn how interfaces support polymorphism â€“ calling the same method on different implementations.
ðŸ”¶ Steps:
Create an interface Playable with method play().
Create two classes: Guitar and Piano, both implement Playable.
Implement the play() method in both classes with different messages.
In main(), declare a reference of type Playable and assign it objects of Guitar and Piano one by one.
Call play() on each.
ðŸ”¶ Expected Output:
Playing Guitar
Playing Piano
